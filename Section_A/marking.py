# There are reasons why this code will not get executed
# 1. Pay attention to how multiple variable are being declared and or assigned in one line otherwise you'll get a ValueError
#   e.g
#   var_a, var_b = 10, 15
#
#   Even though you can do literal assignments of diffent types in one line, it's advisible to only do it for one data type for the sake of readability.
# 
#
# 2. An indentation block is expected after every function definition. Make sure there's logic code for those functions.
#    If the intention was to have empty fumctions, then make sure you pass them. google how to define empty functions.

# 3. Note that True and False are keywords in python so they cant be assigned to variables, However, you can pass them as parameters to the built-in bool() function
#     to emulate booleans.
#     e.g
#     isHungry = bool(False)
#
# 4. Pay attention to usage of undefined values in your code, especially during assignments as is the case with your code.
# 
# 5. Note that the raw_input method is not availble starting with python 3


# Important things to note
#1. You're making use of the SMSMessage classe but haven't yet created it. Look at how to create classes in python and how to initialise them
#2. This answers the question you asked. Make sure that the class methods that you want to use outside of the class are first publicly defined within the class block itself.
#   Your methods are already public. if you need some to be private, google how to define private methods in python
